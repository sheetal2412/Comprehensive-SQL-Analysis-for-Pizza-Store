# Comprehensive-SQL-Analysis-for-Pizza-Store
**Conducted an in-depth analysis of four extensive datasets from a pizza store, employing a range of sophisticated **SQL** techniques**

• Utilized advanced SQL techniques, including the **WHERE** clause for filtering data, the **HAVING** clause for conditions on aggregated data,
various **Aggregate functions** to summarize data, **GROUP BY** for organizing data into meaningful groups, different types of **JOINS** to 
combine data from multiple tables, **Subqueries** to perform nested queries, and **CTE** (Common Table Expressions) for improved readability
and recursive queries, to perform comprehensive and in-depth data analysis.                          
• Developed highly efficient and complex queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze large datasets, resulting in significantly optimized business
insights and greatly improved decision-making processes.
